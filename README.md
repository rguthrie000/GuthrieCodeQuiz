# rguthrie's Coding Quiz

This site is a short timed quiz on Web Development coding knowledge.  The quiz covers current 
knowledge, but throws in a couple of computer science historical questions too. (If you've made
it here, K&R was published in 1978, and 'Adding manpower...' is known as Brooks' Law.)

The game keeps the Top 5 scores by Player Name in browser local storage.  

## Getting Started

This project is hosted on GitHub at https://rguthrie000.github.io/GuthrieCodingQuiz/
The HTML, CSS, and JS files used for the Password Generator are located at repo
rguthrie000/GuthrieCodingQuiz.  In addition to index.html, the assets\css folder has
reset.css, which is linked from index.html's header.  Two javascript files are used for logic 
(script.js), and for the set of questions and answers (questions.js).

### Prerequisites

A web browser is required to interpret/run this program.

### Installing

Copy index.html to the desired execution directory.  Also copy the full assets subdirectory 
to the execution directory.  To run, paste the relative link to index.html in the browser URL box,
then execute.

## Running the tests

The Coding Quiz is easily tested by using its GUI to explore performance against
the requirements.

## Deployment

See Installing, above.

## This page was built with:
VS Code - Smart Editor for HTML and CSS
Google Chrome - browser for display and test
Chrome Inspector - Google Chrome add-on for inspection of page elements

## Versioning
